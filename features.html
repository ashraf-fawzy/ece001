    <h3> 1) Low level programming languages </h3>
        <table border="2" width="60%" align= "center"> 
            <tr>
                <th>Advantages</th>
                <th>Disadvantages </th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Programs developed using low level languages are fast and memory efficient.</td>
                <td>Programs developed using low level languages are machine dependent and are not portable.   </td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>
                    Programmers can utilize processor and memory in better way using a low level language.
                </td>
                <td>
                    It is difficult to develop, debug and maintain.
                </td>
            </tr>
            
            <tr>
                <td>
                    Low level languages provide direct manipulation of computer registers and storage.
                </td>
                <td>
                    Low level programming usually results in poor programming productivity.
                </td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                 <td>It can directly communicate with hardware devices. </td>
                 <td>Programmer must have additional knowledge of the computer architecture of particular machine, for programming in low level language.                </td>
            </tr>
        </table>

        <h3> 2) High level programming languages </h3>
        <table border="2" width="60%" align= "center"> 
            <tr>
                <th>Advantages</th>

            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>High level languages are programmer friendly. They are easy to write Easy to learn, debug and maintain.               </td>
                <td>It takes additional translation times to translate the source to machine code.                </td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>It provide higher level of abstraction from machine languages.                </td>
                <td>High level programs are comparatively slower than low level programs.                </td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>
                    It is machine independent language.
                </td>
                <td>
                    Compared to low level programs, they are generally less memory efficient.
                </td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>
                    Less error prone, easy to find and debug errors.
                </td>
                <td>
                    Cannot communicate directly with the hardware.
                </td>
            </tr>
        </table>
        <h3> 3) Middle Level programming language </h3>
        Hence, we can say that the programming languages which have features of Low Level as well as High Level programming languages known as "Middle Level" programming language.

        C programming languages is the best example of Low Level Programming languages as it has features of low level and high level programming languages both.
