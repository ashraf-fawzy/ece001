    <h1>Types of computer programming languages</h1>
    <p>
        There are basically three types of computer programming languages, they are :
        <ol>
            <li> Low level programming languages</li>
            <li> High level programming languages</li>
            <li> Middle level programming languages</li>
        </ol>

        <h3> 1) Low level programming languages </h3>
            These are machine dependent programming languages such as Binary (Machine code) and Assembly language.

            Since computer only understand the Binary language that means instructions in the form of 0’s and 1’s (Signals - that can be either High or Low , on or off)  ,
            
            so these programming languages are the best way to give signals (Binary Instructions) to the computer directly.

            Machine Code (Binary Language) does not need any interpreter or compiler to convert language in any form because computer understands these signals directly.

            But, Assembly language needs to be converted in equivalent Binary code, so that computer can understand the instructions written in Assembly.
            
            Assembler is used to convert an assembly code to its equivalent Binary code.

            The codes written in such kind of languages are difficult to write, read, edit and understand;
            
            the programs are not portable to any other computer system.

            Low Level programming language programs are faster than High Level programming language programs as they have less keywords, symbols and no need (less need) to convert into Machine Code.

        <h3> 2) High level programming languages </h3>
        
            These are the machine independent programming languages, which are easy to write, read, edit and understand.

            The languages like Java, .Net, Pascal, COBOL, C++, C, C# and other (which are very popular now to develop user end applications). These languages come under the high level programming language category.

            High level programming languages have some special keywords, functions and class libraries by using them we can easily build a program for the computer.

            Computer does not understand program written in such languages directly, as I have written above that computer understands only Machine code. So, here programming translators are required to convert a high level program to its equivalent Machine code.

            Programming translators such as Compilers and Interpreters are the system software’s which converts a program written in particular programming languages to its equivalent Machine code.
        <h3> 3) Middle Level programming language </h3>
       
        Since, there is no such category of computer programming languages, but the programming languages that have features of low level and high level programming languages come under this category.
