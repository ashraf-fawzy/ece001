            The world of computer science, programming and software development starts here .

            Programming language is the language of computers. Through programming language, we can communicate with a computer system. Computers can only understand binary, but humans are not comfortable with binary number system. Humans cannot interact fluently with computers in the language of 0's and 1's. Programming language act as an interface between computers and humans.

            Programming languages are used to create programs. A computer program is intended to perform some specific task through computer or to control the behavior of computer.

            Using a programming language, we write instructions that the computer should perform. Instructions are usually written using characters, words, symbols and decimal. These instructions are later encoded to the computer understandable language i.e. binary language. So that the computer can understand the instructions given by human and can perform specified task.

            Thousands of programming language have been created till date and many are still being developed every year. Every programming language is designed for some specific purpose. Such as FORTRAN, OCaml, Haskell are best suited for scientific and numerical computations. Whereas Java, C++, C# are best suited for designing server applications, games, desktop applications and many more.<br><br><br>
